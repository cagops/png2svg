# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and kind to others
- Give constructive feedback
- Focus on the project and helping each other
- Accept responsibility for your mistakes

## Not Acceptable

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Sharing private information without permission
- Spam or off-topic content
- Any behavior that makes others feel unwelcome

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Warning
- Temporary ban
- Permanent ban

We will respond fairly and focus on keeping the community safe for everyone.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project maintainer cagardalucas@gmail.com.
